#### Perspective

_VPBA is a network and resource for video production professionals in a constantly revolutionizing online world._

_Who will use this interface? For what purposes?_

_Either freelance videographers or persons of influence in video production companies such as business owners, vps and department leaders._
_They'll be there to learn more about the offering, more about the company behind the offering and if converted, will want to make contact to negotiate which offerings they are interested in._
_Future scaled concepts could include offerings that are effective enough to offer to large, already successful video production companies to boost sales and growth further._

#### Personas

_This is Oswald.  Oswald is a pacific islander who lives in "The Colony", a city in Denton county, Texas, and a suburb of the DFW metroplex.  Oswald is immersed in industry living in the metroplex.  He shields himself from the amorality of big corporations by attending a catholic church in the shape of a large box at the end of one of the thousands of strip malls that swath the land around him.  Before marrying, he worked as a unit manager for a financial firm.  Somewhere along the twisted path of Bro-dom and exploitative corporate behavior, Oswald found himself reflecting on his life and wondering if the career decisions he was making were making him happy.  He thought back on his childhood, the last time he really felt an unburdened joy, the feelings of creation and wonderment and that itch in the back of his head ever since he first held a camera.  He talked with his girlfriend at the time, and she was like, "YEA! GO FOR IT!", so he put in his two weeks, bought a new lens for his aging Canon Rebel, and buys himself a stack of 100 business cards._

_"I'm a business now.  A business is like a cartoon character.  It has a hat and some catchphrases, and it's going to make you laugh or reflect on the feelings you feel when it shares a common thread of thought.  I shall be... Punchbox! I love it, and because I am walking this path, I am forced to the conviction that others will to!"_

_And so Oswald bought a business license and became Punchbox media.  But, where to start...  WEDDINGS!~_

_Oswald shot weddings for family and friends of family, but his life felt lacking.  This wasn't what he was born for.  There was no creatiment or wonderjoy.  How for?  Oh, lost!  I must get into commercial development!  I need to appeal to businesses... people with m0-m0-m0ney.  I need... a website!_

_The year is 2006 and websites suck.  Some websites don't, but most do.  They're also ridiculously expensive.  Oswald has been shooting weddings for 4 years -primarily-, as he says.  7-11 was a side job.  He can't afford squat.  But, lo!, come forth a redeemer in the shape of an older nephew who builds webbbsites.  Thank the heavens!  He's an honest man, and the lord descends blessings on his good servants in their time of need._

_The site comes out 6 years later... it's got the info, it's got the pictures, it's got video, the whole checklist kaboodle.  It doesn't look like Nike or anything, but now Punchbox is a company for real.  It's just in time, because in the past 6 years, he's shot 12 weddings, 3 events and 2 online videos._

_Oswald sees his new channel bring contacts in, but it's slow and few people respond to his follow up emails.  He nails a couple start ups for some online video, and the next few years rounds him out at around 20 projects for the year.  It's not enough.  The family feels the stress.  How many years of scraping by will the wife put up with?_

_Enter VPBA!  Business coaching, talent networks and website packages that keep up with modern trends in developing UI/UX and the latest and greatest platforms wahoo!  There's the 6k custom fix-your-brand package, but there's also some nice cheap web template offers with maintenance and things that fit Oswald's price range.  "Thanks VPBA~!  Now, I can attract more clients and better ones at that!  Cause, now my site isn't just better, but me and my business are, too, which was really probably the greatest problem all along..."_
